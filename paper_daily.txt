Title: EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks
- 2019'ICLR
Author: Mingxing Tan; Quoc V.Le
Institude: Google Brain
Motivation: To study model scaling and identity that carefully balancing nertwork depth, width, and resolution,which can lead to better performance
Method: Design a network by using NAS and scale it uo to obtian a family of models named EfficientNets, also, propose 'compound coefficient'

2.
Title: EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection
Author: Mingxing Tan; Ruoming Pang; Quoc V.Le
Institude: Google Brain
Motivation: Make model more efficient
Method: Propose 'BiFPN',a scaling method and a family of networks called EfficientDet
